# routines-bakeoff

A simple app to test static site generation capabilities of Gatsby, Nuxt, and Django

## Data Model

A routine is a list of activities that are displayed as checkboxes each day

```javascript
{
   name: "Morning",
   description: "Getting up and out the door",
   items: [
     "Shower",
     "Get dressed",
     "Take pills",
     "Make coffee",
     "Make breakfast",
     "Eat breakfast",
     "Get badge",
  ]
}
```
## Application

The index page is a list of routines by name and description
Each routine also has a landing page
There is a sitemap listing all these pages

## Implementations

Each implementation is a sub-directory with its own `.gitignore`

### flask-routines-api

This prototypes a serverless application using DynamoDB for data storage. The Python lambda framework
zappa is used to create the zip and to deploy and undeploy in the sandbox.

It will also build the role if needed, but can use a predefined role in the integration environment.

The DynamoDB table can be built and then removed as follows:

```
manage.py create-tables
manage.py delete-tables
```

A zip can be generated with:

```
zappa package
```

The application can be deployed in development with:

```
zappa deploy dev
```

### routines-vue

This is an Single Page Application (SPA) written using Vue.js. It is a little spare on the styling and 
does not use any backend. Because it is written purely in Vue.js, it doesn't know how to build itself as a static site.

The development server is run as follows:

```
npm run serve
```

### routines-nuxt

This is a Static Site Generator (SSG) written using Nuxt.js, which leverages Vue.js. It is also spare on
styling, and has no backend, but a static site can be generated by entering:

```
npm run generate
```
